This is a google homepage project that im working on to practice my html and css skills learned so far.

----- Finished -----
This project challenged me, I used a variety of skills that i learned through the FreeCodeCamp course. I had to use google at some points when i got stuck but overall the project pushed my to my limits and it turned out great.
