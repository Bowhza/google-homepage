This was the first project in the Odin Project's curriculum that I completed. This project made me utilize the skills learned from https://www.freecodecamp.org "Responsive Web Design Certification" course. The most challenging part about the project was placing the elements aroudn the page using various display types. There were a few obstacles along the way that i solved through critical thinking and google searches.
